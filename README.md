# Mobile Apps - Assignment - API - Captcha - Progress - Vuetify

Use this repository to combine the different assignments you made for the course mobile apps.

This includes the following:

* TODO Listing
* Funny Captcha component
* Progress Bar
* GitHub API
* Chuck Norris Question

Make sure to create a view for each of these components and style everything with vuetify. This means you will need to refactor all your components to make use of the vuetify components.

Setup a general application wireframe with at least a `v-main`, a `v-app-bar` and a `v-footer`.

Allow the user to navigate between the different views by means of the `v-app-bar`.

Add some general information about yourself in the `v-footer` component.
